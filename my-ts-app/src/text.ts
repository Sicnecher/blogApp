    I've been involved in this activity for over three decades and in the last two I've been writing on this website about patterns and practices that make it easier to build useful software.
    The site began as a place to put my own writing, but I also use it to publish articles by my colleagues.
    In 2000, I joined Thoughtworks, where my role is to learn about the techniques that we've learned to deliver software for our clients,
    and pass these techniques on to the wider software industry. As this site has developed into a respected platform on software development,
    I've edited and published articles by my colleagues, both ThoughtWorkers and others, to help useful writing reach a wider audience.`
